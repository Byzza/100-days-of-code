# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Sept 18, 2018
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: 
* High level research into Angular Drag and drop and resizing
* Re-Introduced myself to the 100 Day Code Challenge
* Setup 100 Day of Code Log

**Thoughts:** 
I'm been wanting to commit myself to coding/learning every day now for probably the last few month since first hearing about the 100 Code Challenge, and while I've managed a few nights here and there, there has been nothing constant.
By putting this down, I'm making a committment to myself to do atleast an hour every day.
The primary goal for this is to up skill myself with Angular and/or React.
