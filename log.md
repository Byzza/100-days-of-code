# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 18 Sept 2018

**Today's Progress**: 
* High level research into Angular Drag and drop and resizing
* Re-Introduced myself to the 100 Day Code Challenge
* Setup 100 Day of Code Log

**Thoughts:** 
I'm been wanting to commit myself to coding/learning every day now for probably the last few month since first hearing about the 100 Code Challenge, and while I've managed a few nights here and there, there has been nothing constant.
By putting this down, I'm making a committment to myself to do atleast an hour every day.
The primary goal for this is to up skill myself with Angular and/or React.

### Day 1: 19 Sept 2018
**Today's Progress**:
* Angular Template Syntax
- From https://angular.io/guide/template-syntax#property-binding--property-
- To: https://angular.io/guide/template-syntax#two-way-binding---

**Thoughts:**
It was quite a long and tiring day today and I left my study/coding too late.  I only managed to get about 30min in before I was completely glossing over what I was reading.
